I subscribed to Ivan's mentorship with a background in Ruby & RoR.
Due to his trainings, got pretty inspired about SPA applications as well. Despite my love to Ruby,
you can't avoid JS today, and after his program – you don't want to :)

If you're experienced developer, Ivan always find a few non-trivial tasks for you to think
upon. And if you're newbie – it's hard to imagine the more appropriate language to start than JavaScript.
Also, I'm very grateful when mentors try to help you with employment.

To underline, the program and communication were very good so I recommend Ivan's mentorship
to everyone interested in modern webdev.
