Subscribed to Ivan's mentorship having no practice in my baggage, only a scarce JS theory.
Just in two weaks I've got the skills I wanted, mastered the basics of ReactJS, and
wrote my first realistic frontend application.

In the course of training, quickly realized that I turned to a right person. With no prior experience,
that's exactly how I imagined the mentored learning. I would like to highlight Ivan's code
reviews, going to the point where each variable finally starts to reflect the essence of the
underlying processes and data.

I can tell you that this mentor appreciates the time of his students, does not load you with
unnecessary and boring material, and from the first days brings you directly to your learning goals.
All you need is to listen carefully, be able to useÂ Google, patience and desire to learn.
I will certainly back as soon as new exercises and questions arise.
