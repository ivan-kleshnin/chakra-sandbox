I'd like to tell about Ivan who was my mentor for a month. During this month he was
open for any question 24/7, ready to help with all problems I asked him about. With just
a few lessons it was clear that this person has a huge baggage of knowledge and he's willing
to share it with his students. The main educational focus was on practice which is an undeniable
advantage to many other courses I tried. I can confidently say that training with this mentor
will yield good results.
