I was lucky to get an experience of learning and working with Ivan as my mentor.
Ivan raised clear and detailed technical tasks that were interesting to solve.
Ivan answered my questions and created an individual training plan for me to become a front-end developer.
Now I'm a junior frontend developer at EPAM!
It was pleasant and useful to cooperate with Ivan, I highly recommend his courses and learning content in general.
