I was mentored by Ivan for several months now, and I highly recommend him. During this time,
he has shown that he has the technical and interpersonal skills that make him a truly exceptional
mentor. He helped me to become front-end developer step by step. He gave me interesting and,
sometimes, challenging tasks, which was great for my motivation. If I ever had a question, he
provided intelligible explanations and usually advised me where I could get more info.
Our level of communication was great. Ivan has been always ready to answer my questions or give
a good advice. Ivan excels at supervising, guiding and motivating. I am confident you will be
pleased with his abilities and professionalism.
