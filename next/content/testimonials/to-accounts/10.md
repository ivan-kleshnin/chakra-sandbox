Studied with Ivan for about a month and found a job after that. Straightaway I felt myself
like a pioneer: new discovery, new knowledge or at least new experience every day.
I have to say, I realized a substantial difference between an unguided learning and a mentored one.

Going to details – I've quickly got an invidividual learning plan with the goals of filling my
knowledge gaps. I've got a concrete learning vector. It helps a lot, when you can concentrate
on things that matter the most right now.

Responses were almost immediate. You send a question – you'll get an answer. Unfolded and detailed
as it should be. Should I mention that code reviews, refactoring advices, attention to details
and the whole level of communication were simply great?! I'm totally happy and will definitely
continue my study with Ivan soon.
