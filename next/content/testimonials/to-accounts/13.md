From the first days, Ivan revealed the specifics of the Frontend profession to me. Made and individual
learning plan, based on my needs. In the process of learning, he made qualitative code reviews which
helped me to write more sophisticated and expressive code. Also he responded in details to all my
questions and motivated me whenever I was stuck. Evidently, I recommend Ivan Kleshnin as a JavaScript
mentor and will continue my engagement with him.
