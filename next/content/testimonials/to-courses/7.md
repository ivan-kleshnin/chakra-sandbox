Awesome course! Mini-videos of 10-15 minutes, properly structured, for which it is convenient to repeat 
and find information. Everyone probably knows this effect: while you are watching, itâ€™s understandable,
but when you start practicing, everything goes out of your head. In such cases, it is important to have 
an easy and quick way to find THAT information. I didn't have this problem in this course. 
It feels like something similar to how you used to learn from books. Only more interactive and convenient.
In ordinary text books there's sometimes difficult to tell what author really means and videos
are better in this regard.

After passing, you can use the course as a reference, because. there is no subscription. I come back 
from time to time, but I feel that I have already memorized a lot from the Nth time :) It's cool 
that there are practical tasks on the topic that are slightly different from those discussed in the video,
but not so much as to get stuck. I have tried many free courses but they only cover the basics. 
I probably watched gigabytes of videos from such resources, but I always had the impression that, 
after the initial progress, I've been stagnating. This course has shown excellent efficiency and I have 
made good progress. Kinda reached a new level.
