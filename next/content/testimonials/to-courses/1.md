I always thought that I can learn everything myself: with books and Google. Hovewer, the more
I dug deeper into tech, the more I started to realize that I really need an outside perspective.
When I saw Ivan's post at Linkedin, I decided to try his course and did make the right call.
The program is built in a way that you learn all the necessary foundation to work with React
in a short term. The emphasis here is on practice and the unobvious places of theory are discussed
on webinars. In my opinion, it's a great format for newbies! A huge thanks to ivan for the
priceless experience. Highly recommend.
