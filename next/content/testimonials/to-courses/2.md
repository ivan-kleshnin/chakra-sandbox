I want to thank for the quality and structured course. From the first lessons, you feel
confidence in the teacher and you understand that Ivan is a real professional in his field.
A person with a lot of experience who skillfully conveys it in his videos. I really liked the 
disclosure of various topics by Ivan, everything is clear, and most importantly – in-depth. With each
video, the "magic" of React disappeared more and more, everything became clear and it's actually pretty cool! 
I definitely recommend the course to anyone who hesitate – all your doubts will drop after watching 
the first lessons, I guarantee you. Thank you for sharing experience, Ivan, it was comfortable
and interesting to take your course!
