"Choose not a course, but a teacher." For me, the main criterion for buying this or that educational 
material is the personality of the author. Ivan is definitely a professional in his field.
You can verify this by watching his YouTube video. The main difference of this course is that this
is not just another retelling of the documentation, but the author's view on the development 
of React applications. Ivan pays attention and talks about the details that most simply omit (or don't know). 
The course will make you think and after it you will look at many things differently. That is why 
I recommend this course, including for those who already have experience developing with React. 
Special thanks to Ivan for the video recording of answers to questions and consultations!
