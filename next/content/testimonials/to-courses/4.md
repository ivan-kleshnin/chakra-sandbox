I regularly watch Ivan's videos on YouTube as I like his presentation style. 
So, generally speaking, I had no doubts about the quality of the course, but I got even more than expected. 
The content really includes the most extensive material on React and Frontend. In three weeks, I had 
a confident understanding of React and decent skills to work on it. I think that this is an excellent 
result for such a period. The content is completely different from the documentation, it contains 
valuable comments on the theory and practice of development. A couple of times I came to a dead end, 
there was a feeling that I could not solve this or that problem. But each time Ivan encouraged me, 
pushed me in the right direction. I ended up doing all the projects in 3.5 weeks. But, of course, 
I had to push myself.
