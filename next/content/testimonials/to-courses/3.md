Excellent course! The content is the richest. I watched most of the videos three times - each time 
learning something new. Interesting projects, it's clear that they are taken from real practice. 
After the course, I decided to go through several interviews. Unexpectedly, I received two job offers: 
one for a paid internship, the second for the second stage of the interview. I won't tell you the results yet :)
