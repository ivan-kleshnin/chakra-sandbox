The course "Development on React" is suitable for those who already know HTML/CSS/JS and want to take
the next step to learn React. Even for me, a person who already had relevant experience and took 
the course more to close the gaps rather than to learn from scratch, the program turned out to be 
interesting and useful. The course covers the basics of React programming and development in detail.
There are no outdated topics, as in other sources – we are talking exclusively about the modern 
capabilities of the library. I believe that this course provides a good base of knowledge on React 
and opens up opportunities for further study of more complex topics. Also, after viewing this course
and completing test projects, you can try to get a job as a Junior React developer. 
If you already speak English and learned some algorithms... – but that's another topic :)
